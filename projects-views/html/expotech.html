          <strong>Expotech 2025</strong>  was an incredible experience that taught me valuable lessons. During this event, senior students from the ¡Supérate! centers across the country presented their 2024 projects to representatives from Microsoft and Fundación Poma, showcasing innovation, creativity, and teamwork. The environment was inspiring, with many students demonstrating how much they had grown through their work.

My participation included two key roles. First, I was one of the backup presenters, which meant staying prepared to support other teams if needed—an experience that taught me responsibility and adaptability. My main role, however, was presenting our digital project <strong>TrackMate</strong> with my team. TrackMate is an automotive maintenance application, and we worked hard to explain its purpose and features clearly and confidently.

Presenting in front of professionals was challenging but also exciting. All the preparation paid off, and we were able to deliver our message in the best possible way. Overall, Expotech 2025 strengthened my confidence, improved my presentation skills, and reminded me how valuable teamwork and stepping out of your comfort zone can be.
