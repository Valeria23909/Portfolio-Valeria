          <strong>Jóvenes Unidos a Una Sola Voz</strong> is a project that aims to empower young people from the communities of Santa Tecla and Santa Ana. We work through SOS Children’s Villages, collaborating with multiple partners to provide activities that strengthen the active and successful participation of more than 2,200 young people in local decision-making processes, ensure their human rights, and encourage them to become agents of social transformation for a fairer and more equitable society.

Being part of this volunteer program was an enriching and enjoyable experience. During the first year, we took classes on project creation, leadership skills, and the importance of teamwork. We also developed educational games for children focused on human rights.

In the second year, we participated in recreational outings, and my team created the project “Academic Vision,” an initiative aimed at providing students with portable projectors and other useful devices such as speakers and cases.
Our project was selected as one of the winners, and we received $3,000 in funding to make it a reality. By the end of 2024, we had already donated three portable projectors with their respective cases and speakers, as well as whiteboards.
I feel proud and happy to have made this donation to my school together with my team and the Youth with a Voice group.
