          <strong>Expo ¡Supérate!</strong> Expo ¡Supérate! is a project fair organized by students from educational programs such as Fundación Poma in El Salvador and Fundación Alberto Motta in Panama. During these events, young participants present innovative solutions to real-life problems, applying their knowledge in technology, English, and values. The projects focus on creating platforms, applications, and initiatives with social, environmental, or community impact.

Expo BrightMinds was an unforgettable experience that marked a turning point in my life. I tried new things, overcame fears, and discovered skills I didn’t know I had. I was part of the backend programming team, where I developed my abilities and found a genuine passion for coding. I also participated in the pitch and project presentation, which I delivered in English in front of members of the Poma family. It was a moment that made me feel fulfilled and truly happy.
